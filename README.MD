## 🧭 Learning Outline

### 🟢 Stage 1: Introduction & Environment Setup
- [ ] What is C and why learn it?
- [ ] Install GCC / Online compilers (Replit, CodeChef, etc.)
- [ ] Setup text editor (VS Code, Vim, Emacs)
- [ ] Compile and run your first program using `gcc`

### 🟡 Stage 2: Basics of C
- [ ] Structure of a C program
- [ ] `main()` and return types
- [ ] Header files (`#include`)
- [ ] Data types: `int`, `float`, `char`, `double`
- [ ] I/O: `printf()` and `scanf()`
- [ ] Comments

### 🟠 Stage 3: Control Flow
- [ ] Conditionals: `if`, `else if`, `else`, `switch`
- [ ] Loops: `for`, `while`, `do...while`
- [ ] Control statements: `break`, `continue`, `goto`

### 🔵 Stage 4: Functions
- [ ] Declaring and defining functions
- [ ] Parameters and return types
- [ ] Variable scope
- [ ] Recursion

### 🟣 Stage 5: Arrays and Strings
- [ ] 1D and 2D arrays
- [ ] Array operations (sum, reverse, sort)
- [ ] Strings: `strlen()`, `strcpy()`, `strcmp()`, `strcat()`

### 🔴 Stage 6: Pointers
- [ ] Understanding memory and addresses
- [ ] Pointer syntax and arithmetic
- [ ] Pointers and arrays
- [ ] Dynamic memory: `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()`, `free()`

### 🟤 Stage 7: Structures & Unions
- [ ] Using `struct` and nested structures
- [ ] `typedef`
- [ ] `union` and memory sharing

### ⚫ Stage 8: File Handling
- [ ] Opening and closing files
- [ ] Reading and writing: `fopen()`, `fread()`, `fwrite()`
- [ ] Other functions: `fprintf()`, `fscanf()`, `fgets()`, `fputs()`

### ⚪ Stage 9: Advanced Topics
- [ ] Command line arguments: `argc`, `argv`
- [ ] Bitwise operators
- [ ] Preprocessor: `#define`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`
- [ ] Debugging memory issues (Valgrind)

### 💡 Stage 10: Projects and Practice
- [ ] Calculator
- [ ] Student record system
- [ ] Tic-Tac-Toe game
- [ ] File-based mini database
- [ ] Solve problems on HackerRank / LeetCode / Project Euler
